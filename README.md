# KanjiOS

KanjiOS is a web application that allows users to manage, visualize, edit and learn more than 2136 kanjis.

The project is designed to generate a database that can be downloadable in SQLite and used for web development or mobile applications.

We also provide the database with 2136 Kanji, which is expected to be completed by December 31, 2024, when we will launch the final version.
